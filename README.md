#Help App
Our app is for deaf and dumb, as we all know that deaf and dumb are having a lot of problem for communicating with people around them, and one of the most important problems is that they can't call emergency when they want it cause they can't talk so the main idea of our app is that make calling easier for them, therefore the app will show situations of the emergency needs that deaf and dumb may have then the app will send their location to the emergency,and the app will call the emergency and a robot will ask for help, so they handle there condition and help them, and everyone will have an account that contains there ID and all information that the emergency will need . and we think to add languages so the user will choose what is the language that suites him.
